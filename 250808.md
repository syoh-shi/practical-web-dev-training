## How the Internet Works
- Internet: When a domain is requested, DNS finds the corresponding IP address and returns the relevant file to the user.
- **Three core technologies:**
  - **HTML**: The contents of the site.
  - **CSS**: Styling of the site.
  - **JavaScript**: Functionality and interactions.
- Right-click, then go to **Inspect** in Chrome Developer Tools — very useful.
