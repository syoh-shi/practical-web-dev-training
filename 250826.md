# CSS Selectors

## Parts of Outside Rules
- **Selector**: e.g. `h1`, `a`, `p`
- **Property and Value**: key-value pairs applied to the selector

---

## Class Selector

```html
<h2 class="red-heading">Red</h2>
````

```css
.red-heading {
  color: red;
}
```

* You can use the same class for multiple elements.

---

## ID Selector

```html
<h2 id="main">Red</h2>
```

```css
#main {
  color: red;
}
```

* An **ID selector** applies to only **one element** in each HTML file.

---

## Attribute Selector

```html
<p draggable="true">Drag Me</p>
<p draggable="false">Drag Me</p>
```

```css
p[draggable="true"] {
  color: red;
}
```

* Targets elements based on attributes and values.

---

## Universal Selector

```css
* {
  color: red;
}
```

* Applies to **every element** on the page.

---

## Note

⚠️ The cost of interrupted work: **most speed**
(CSS selectors that are too general, like `*`, can slow down rendering.)
